# Intelligent Trainer
"Intelligent Trainer" is a Machine Vision/Machine Learning based desktop application which offers live workout analysis (by using any web cam or laptop's camera) of the multiple different exercises to perform them precisely without any physical fitness trainer. Trainee can also record the video while performing the exercise and can later analyze it by using this application. It informs the trainee that he is performing the exercise perfectly or not by displaying on the screen and also counts the successive repetitions of the desired exercise.
